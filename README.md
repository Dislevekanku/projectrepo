Problem statement:
SpaceX advertises Falcon9 rockets with a cost of 62 million dollars while other providers cost more than 150 million dollars, this is due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage. The ability to determine if the first stage will successfully land is crucial in estimating the cost of a launch. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning algorithm that will predict the success rate of the first stage landing

Methodology:
Data collection methodology:
Data was collected from SpaceX API and web scraping from google
Perform data wrangling
One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
Perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
Perform predictive analysis using classification models
How to build, tune, evaluate classification models

Conclusion:
We can conclude that:
The greater the number of launches at a site, the greater the success rate
KSC LC-39A was the most successful launch site
The Decision tree classifier is the best machine learning algorithm for this project
