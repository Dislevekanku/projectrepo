SpaceX advertises Falcon9 rockets with a cost of 62 million dollars while other providers cost more than 150 million dollars, this is due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage. The ability to determine if the first stage will successfully land is crucial in estimating the cost of a launch. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning algorithm that will predict the success rate of the first stage landing
